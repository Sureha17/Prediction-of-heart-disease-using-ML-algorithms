# Prediction-of-heart-disease-using-ML-algorithms

In this project a heart disease dataset has been used.Two machine learning algorithms has been used to predict the accuracy of the disease.Finally which algorithm gives the best accuracy is found.visualization is also done in tableau to find the people with the most affected based on the parameter levels.
